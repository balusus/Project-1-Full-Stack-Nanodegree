## How to successfully run the application
Download the repository and install http-server npm package.

<b>HTTP-SERVER</b> is a simple, zero-configuration command-line http server. It is powerful enough for production usage, but it's simple and hackable enough to be used for testing, local development, and learning.

<b>Usage:</b>
 http-server [path] [options]
 
[path] defaults to ./public if the folder exists, and ./ otherwise.

Then open fresh_tomatoes.html file in your local server.
