# Project-1-Full-Stack-Nanodegree
This is the first project for Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree
## How to successfully run the application
Download the repository and install http-server npm package.

<b>HTTP-SERVER</b> is a simple, zero-configuration command-line http server. It is powerful enough for production usage, but it's simple and hackable enough to be used for testing, local development, and learning.

<b>Usage:</b>
 http-server [path] [options]
 
[path] defaults to ./public if the folder exists, and ./ otherwise.

There are three python files : 

 * <b>entertainment_center.py</b> - Builds the movie list and calls the method to generate the web page.
 
 * <b>fresh_tomatoes.py</b> - Takes in a list of movies and builds the HTML and opens up your default browser to display the generated HTML page.
 
 * <b>media.py</b> - Contains the class that provides the data structure to hold movie information.

And then, <b>fresh_tomatoes.html</b> will be generated when you run the program as described above. This file is the actual web page you would see in your browser
